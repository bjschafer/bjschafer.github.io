I'm currently finishing my sophomore year.  I prefer Python (3) but also know Java.  My next language is C or C++.  I can also do some bash.  I'm a huge Linux supporter, and currently use it on my beefy desktop.  My laptop is a MacBook Air and it's pretty okay too.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
