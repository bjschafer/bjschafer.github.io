I'm a CS student at Ripon College, minoring in Spanish.  I graduate in August.  Most of my programming is done in Python, C++, and Bash, but I'm also more or less fluent in C, Java, C# (including ASP.NET), MSSQL, Sqlite, and LaTeX.\r\n\r\nMy pet project right now is [Brewmaster](http://bjschafer.github.io/brewmaster), a tool for managing multiple computers using Homebrew.
