I'm a CS student at UW-Oshkosh, minoring in Spanish.  I'm a junior.  I prefer Python (3) but also know Java.  For work, I've programmed in C#.NET and ASP.NET, as well as (T)-SQL.  My next language is C or C++.  I can also do some bash.  I'm a huge Linux supporter, and currently use it on my beefy desktop.  My laptop is a MacBook Air and it's pretty okay too.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
